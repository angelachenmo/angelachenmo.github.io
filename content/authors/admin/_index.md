Business 👩🏻‍💼, Data Science 👩🏻‍💻, Research 👩🏻‍🔬, Social Good 👩🏻‍🏭 are my areas of focus.

I live in 🇨🇦, was made in 🇨🇳, and my mind belongs to 🌏! A humanitarian by heart. 

I genuinely believe in good people and the capability that we can all make a difference in our society with the power of kindness, science, and research. 

I enjoy talking with great minds coming from all fields.
